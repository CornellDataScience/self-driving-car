Implementation Notes:
--------------------
We need to map Image Points to Object Points.
Image Points: The coordinates of the corners in these 2D images 
- To get image points, I am using cv2.findChessboardCorners.
Object Points: The 3D coordinates of real undistorted chess board corners
- The object points are known; they are the known coordinates of the chessboard corners for a 9x6 board. 
- This points will be 3D coordinates.
- For an 9x6 board:
     Top left corner = (0,0,0)
     Bottom right corner = (8,5,0)
     The z, in (x,y,z) is 0 for all corners, since the chessboard is a flat 2D surface.
